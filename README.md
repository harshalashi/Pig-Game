Getting Started

How to Play

To play the game, players take turns rolling two dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. The sum of the dice is added to the player's current score, and the turn ends if the player rolls a "1" on either die. If a player chooses to "Hold" their current score, their turn ends, and their current score is added to their total score. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
